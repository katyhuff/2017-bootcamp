## PI4 Computational Bootcamp

This is the material from a 2 week Computational Bootcamp for PI4 students prior to beginning summer internships as part of the NSF funded [PI4 Program for Interdisciplinary and Industrial Internships at Illinois](https://pi4.math.illinois.edu/). 

This year the focus is shifting to the use and analysis of large and complex data.
In previous years, courses focused more on numerical analysis. Materials from [2016](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hirani/cbmg/index.html), [2015](http://math.illinois.edu/~shahkar2/cbmg/), [2014](http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~hirani/teaching/cbmgsu14) are available through these links.
