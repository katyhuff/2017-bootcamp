# Computational Bootcamp 2017

Computational Bootcamp for the PI4 program, Department of Mathematics,  University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign

## Instructors: 

David LeBauer, Carl R Woese Institute for Genomic Biology

Neal Davis, Deparatment of Comptuer Science, University of Illinois

Teaching Assistant: Vaibhav Karve, Department of Mathematics


## Objective

To teach methods in data analysis and computation to Math graduate students in 2 weeks to students with little or no programming experience.

This is the material from a 2 week Computational Bootcamp for PI4 students prior to beginning summer internships as part of the NSF funded [PI4 Program for Interdisciplinary and Industrial Internships at Illinois](https://pi4.math.illinois.edu/). 

## Pre-requisites

Students should be familiar with the R and Python programming languages. 

Students are required to take two free courses from DataCamp and email their completion certificates by midnight June 25. Each course should take a few hours to complete.

Required: [Introduction to R](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/free-introduction-to-r) and [Introduction to Python for Data Science](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science).

Exceptions: students who have experience with R and / or Python may be excused from these requirements. Please email the instructors with a sample of code that you have written.
